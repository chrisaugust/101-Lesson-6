What is a bug?
  A human error in code


The Broad View of Debugging

1) Identify the Problem
2) Understand the Problem
3) Implement a Solution


Types of Errors

Type 1 -- syntax errors
  code doesn't conform to rules of the language
  generally stop code from running
Type 2 -- logic errors
  may not stop code from running, but gives unexpected results

What is pry?
  a gem
  a REPL

Using pry
  as an irb
    cd to jump into an object
    ls to show available methods for an object  
  invoking pry at runtime
    using binding.pry
      binding contains references to all variables in scope at point of creation
      pry interrupts program execution and opens the binding to allow inspection

Where to put binding.pry withing a program?
  avoid putting it at the end of a block or method
    (because it could affect return values)

Stepping through code with pry-byebug
  extends pry with additional commands:
    next
    step -- allows to step into the next bit of code to be executed
    continue
  
Recap
  Debugging is an extremely important skill to learn and practice
  pry and pry-byebug make debugging easier, and also help expose the inner workings of code


commonly used commands
-----------------------
require 'pry'
binding.pry
cd 
ls
exit    to move to next REPL cycle
exit!   to exit pry
